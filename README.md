## What is Matrix Watcher?

Matrix Watcher is a real-time monitoring system that observes multiple independent data sources simultaneously, detecting anomalies and discovering correlations that emerge from chaos.

**Live System:** [matrixwatcher.space](https://matrixwatcher.space)

---

## Data Sources

The system continuously monitors 7 independent global streams:

| Source | Data |
|--------|------|
| **Cryptocurrency** | BTC/ETH price movements, volatility patterns |
| **Blockchain** | Network metrics, block intervals |
| **Quantum RNG** | True randomness from quantum fluctuations |
| **Space Weather** | Solar activity, geomagnetic storms |
| **Seismic** | Global earthquake activity |
| **Weather** | Atmospheric anomalies |
| **News** | Global event streams |

## How It Works

1. **Anomaly Detection** — Each sensor independently flags statistical deviations
2. **Cluster Analysis** — When multiple sources show anomalies within 30 seconds, a correlation cluster forms
3. **Pattern Learning** — Historical patterns are tracked and analyzed
4. **Predictions** — Based on observed correlations, not speculation

All statistics are honest and verifiable. The system observes — it doesn't fabricate.

## Core Principles

- **Honesty** — No inflated statistics, no fake predictions
- **Independence** — Each data source operates autonomously
- **Transparency** — Open source, verifiable algorithms
- **Observation** — We track correlations, not causation
