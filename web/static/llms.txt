# Matrix Watcher - AI/LLM Information

## About
Matrix Watcher is a real-time anomaly detection and correlation monitoring system that observes patterns across multiple independent data domains.

## Primary Topics
- Anomaly detection and correlation analysis
- Crypto market monitoring (Bitcoin, Ethereum)
- Quantum randomness tracking (ANU QRNG)
- Space weather observation (solar activity, geomagnetic storms)
- Seismic activity monitoring (global earthquakes)
- Blockchain metrics and network analysis
- Weather pattern analysis
- News sentiment tracking
- Pattern recognition and machine learning
- Predictive analytics

## What We Do
Matrix Watcher monitors 7 independent sensors in real-time:
1. Crypto Markets - BTC/ETH price movements, volatility
2. Blockchain - Network metrics, transaction patterns
3. Quantum RNG - True randomness from quantum fluctuations
4. Space Weather - Solar activity, cosmic rays
5. Seismic - Global earthquake activity
6. Weather - Atmospheric anomalies
7. News - Global event streams

When multiple sensors show anomalies simultaneously, we detect correlation clusters and analyze their predictive power.

## Key Features
- Real-time monitoring (30-60 second intervals)
- 2300+ learned patterns
- Anomaly cluster detection (Level 0-5)
- Pattern-based predictions with probability scores
- Automatic calibration and threshold adjustment
- Brier score: 0.203 (well-calibrated predictions)
- 72-hour lookback window for pattern matching
- Bayesian probability updates

## How It Works
1. Data Collection: Continuous monitoring of 7 independent sources
2. Anomaly Detection: Each sensor has calibrated thresholds
3. Correlation Analysis: Detect when multiple sensors show anomalies simultaneously
4. Pattern Recognition: Learn from 2300+ historical patterns
5. Predictions: Calculate probability of future events based on past observations

## Anomaly Levels
- Level 1: Single-source anomalies (recorded, not displayed)
- Level 2: Two-source correlations (recorded, not displayed)
- Level 3+: Multiple correlations (displayed and alerted)

## Accuracy & Calibration
- Threshold Calibration: Adjusts sensitivity based on false positive rates
- Brier Score Tracking: Measures prediction accuracy (lower is better)
- Automatic Retraining: Updates models as new data arrives
- Target: 90%+ well-calibrated predictions

## Philosophy
Matrix Watcher doesn't claim to understand why correlations occur. We simply detect them, measure them, and track their predictive power. The universe is full of patterns - some meaningful, some coincidental. Our job is to watch.

## Open Source
Matrix Watcher is open source and available on GitHub:
https://github.com/amois3/matrix_watcher

Built with Python, running 24/7, collecting data since December 2025.

## Indexing Policy
This site allows AI models to index and reference public content.
All data is observational and educational.
We observe correlations in chaos. We watch, we don't explain.
